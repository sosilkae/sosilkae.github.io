							<p class="blue-text">Western Union's money transfer infrastructure is a complicated, outdated system that competes against both established transfer apps and other new faces in the payment sector. Their process is cluttered and can be emotionally taxing for its users.

						<div class="grid-col-1of2">
							<p class="blue-text">Western Union Messenger is for the migrant workers in rapidly growing areas, like Dubai, who are sending money to their family back home. In 2012, the migrant worker sent home total of $526 billion in remittance, and this number is set to cross the $700 billion mark in 2016.
							</p>

						<div class="grid-col-1of2">
							<p class="blue-text">
							Western Union Messenger gives us the perfect opportunity to solve a larger issue regarding emotional welfare and communication in the lives of migrant workers. With constant stress and responsibility to take care of the family, the addition of handling money transfers becomes a process full of unnecessary anxiety, miscommunication, and general confusion.

							<h4 class="title4 blue-text">Money is Integrated into the Conversation</h5>
							<p class="blue-text extra">Western Union’s current process only focuses on the money sending aspect. However there are gaps in between where the user needs to seek other means of communication to contact the person they are sending money to. We saw this as an opportunity to fill in the touch-points in between the process to ease anxiety of the user and create a seamless experience.

							<h4 class="title4 blue-text">1 -- Utilize Existing Stores</h3>
							<p class="blue-text">Western Union differentiates itself from competitors with its global reach of physical store locations in more than 200 countries. Recipients are able to receive transfers in cash if they don’t have a bank account--however, customers may face unexpected additional processes upon visiting a location. We wanted to tackle this friction point so we created a scannable, password-protected page in which customers can use as verification when they pick up a money transfer--removing frustrations around the hassle, stress, and time spent in-store.

What I enjoy most about this is the chance to exercise my creative abilities with each new project. Every month I work independently on bi-weekly deliverables which range from producing and editing 15-20 social media photos, specific marketing product shoots for newsletters, video snippets, and illustrations for updating any design collateral.</p>

Because the Kara Yoo brand identity is still developing, my art direction and creative input plays a substantial visual impact on its personality. To make sure the content is aligned with expectations, I present curated mood boards to Kara and the Marketing Consultant.</p>

						<div class="grid-col-1of2">
							<p class="blue-text">This helps my employer and I understand how we want the content to target our audience, and in what way we want to build a relationship with them. Discussing the moodboards allows us to communicate any feedback on the direction we will continue to work in. As a result, I have had the pleasure of seeing her Instagram feed come to life.
