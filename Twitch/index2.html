                    <p class="black-text">As we talked to people, our preconceptions around Twitch started to change dramatically, and so we started being more careful to test our ideas before latching on to them. As we started to think about creating an experience around passive watching in the mobile app, we decided it would be important to do some research around how people currently use the Twitch mobile app vs the desktop version.
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="black-text">We created a survey and posted it to a Vancouver Community Meetup Group, Powered by Twitch on Facebook. From their responses we uncovered that most people who watch streams on desktop also watched on mobile. Viewers answered that they use it mostly when they are away from their desktop, like during commutes, at their friend’s house, and when they’re at school. More importantly, viewers will watch while doing other things such as, browse the internet, do homework, and play games.

                    <p class="black-text">Having worked together before, the two of us remember a project where a mistake we had made, in our group of 6, was not having a solid shared understanding of our persona. This lead to a lot miscommunication and time wasted.

                    With this being such a unique group to us both, we wanted to make sure we were on the same page, and so we developed a persona to help guide our design decisions.

                    <p class="black-text">At the beginning of our project we did a lot of exercises to explore high-level concepts. There’s a saying that “your best idea is either your 1st or your 100th, and you won’t know until you come up with your 100th.”

                    <p>We took some of these ideas and fleshed them out a bit further before we settled on designing the passive watching experience for the always-on player. Below are some of those explorations.</p>

                    <p class="black-text">We wanted to really put our ideas through some rigor, not only from a user perspective, but also from a business perspective. During our project we regularly got critique from Adam, a SR. UX Designer at Twitch focussed on monetization. He helped us understand Twitch’s strategic goals and challenged us to make more real world considerations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="black-text">
                    After considering Adam’s feedback we realized we needed to investigate how and when people are watching streams. We looked to Twitch communities on Facebook to get some feedback, and through our research it helped us get a better understanding of how viewers were watching in different contexts than we expected.

                    <p class="black-text">The idea of a pop-out player is nothing new. However, taking care to design a thought-through experience for the passive viewer, we believe, is an important consideration that we currently don’t see in existing products. Passive viewing is a very real behaviour that is increasing in the digital space with the influx of live streaming.

                    <p>This project was our attempt to address this in 4 weeks, but as this relatively new viewing habits increases, so will the decisions that will need to be made around the interface.</p>

                    <p>Hopefully some of the ideas presented can serve as inspiration for other platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, or any others that wish to enter the live streaming space.
