						<div class="grid-col-1of2">
							<h3 class="title5 blue-text">Purpose</h3>
							<p class="blue-text">After the occasional monthly burst of wanting-to-make-a-difference-in-the-world, I decided to finally act on that energy. I wanted to give to a cause I resonated with, and in some way share that with people I knew. My goal was to produce something of my own from start to finish, and share the profit with an organisation of my choice, the Canadian Mental Health Association.

				<div class="grid-col-1of1">
					<p class="example-caption blue-text">This pin is an illustration of a girl blanketed by her own hair. She seems contemplative, pensive, or perhaps even anxious. The idea I wanted to express was a figure submerged in their own self--a way for them to take time to reflect and reevaluate. I also designed cards with linescape visuals to complement the submerged-like illustration</p>

							<h3 class="title5 blue-text">Learning Something New</h3>
							<p class="blue-text">Sourcing manufacturers was a unique experience, and something I had never done before. I wanted to challenge myself and try to see through an entire a low-scale production project. This project included researching the product needs, reaching out to different manufacturers, and learning the basics of setting up a small e-commerce website.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="grid-col-1of2">
							<h3 class="title5 blue-text">Casual Marketing</h3>
							<p class="blue-text">I used Instagram as my main source of advertising. I started with sneak peek Instagram Stories to see who was interested, and got a lot of feedback! Though my goal was to sell them casually to friends and family, I later decided to set up an e-commerce website to cater to the interest in my social network.</p>

							<p class="blue-text">I originally ordered 50 pieces, but after a couple sneakpeek posts I received a lot of interest, and sold out of pins before I could put them on my e-commerce website. I currently am in the process and running a re-order, and will be conducting pre-sale orders.</p>

							<h3 class="title5 blue-text">Takeaway</h3>
							<p class="blue-text">As one of my first personal projects, I am very touched to see so many of my friends and followers express their interest in the pin and the cause. Although this is a very small step to making a contribution to the world, it was something I had never done and shared with people before. I am proud of being able to share my work with others, and how this aligns with how I want to continue to do work with a purpose bigger than myself.
